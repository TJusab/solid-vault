# Solid Vault | Devpost
## 💻About

_**Solid Vault** Generates robust and secure passwords based on provided character sets (uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters). Furthermore, the user can choose a word to include in his generated password to make it easier to remember for the user._

## 🎯Inspiration

For this project, we took inspiration from our day-to-day life. With educational, governmental, and personal online accounts, each having different password requirements, there must be a better way to generate stronger passwords. And so, we made the better way.


## 👨🏻‍💻Tech Stack

We built **Solid Vault** using
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) micro web framework
- [Jinja](https://github.com/pallets/jinja) web template engine
- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

## 🙌🏻Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

At the beginning this project, we knew we wanted to work on the cybersecurity project but didn't quite know what languages or frameworks to use. Hence, even though part of our team had prior experience coding in Python, we all discovered Jinja and the Flask framework. Those who did not have knowledge of HTML and CSS were the ones working with it.

### 🖱️Technical learning
- Learned how to use Flask and Jinja
- Improving our understanding of HTML and CSS
- Gain hands-on experience with Python

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑Team learning
- Adequate distribution of roles and workload
- Communication
- Pear-tutoring

## ⚡What's next for Solid Vault
We are obviously very proud of Solid Vault as it is, building such a tool with the prior knowledge we had in such a short time span is not easy. That is why we think our project has a lot of potential and could be expanded to other use cases. For example, Solid Vault could:

- Assess the strength of a password and the average speed of brute-force attacks on it
- Suggest tips and tricks for better password practices
- Store passwords securely and locally
